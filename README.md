### User Story

```
AS A user, I want to be able to view create and track daily workouts. 

I want to be able to log multiple exercises in a workout on a given day. 

I should also be able to track the name, type, weight, sets, reps, and duration of exercise. 

If the exercise is a cardio exercise, 
I should be able to track my distance traveled.
